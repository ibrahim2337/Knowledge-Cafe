              What Is Difference Between Props And State ?

              Simply put, State is the local state of the component which cannot
              be accessed and modified outside of the component. It's equivalent
              to local variables in a function. Props, on the other hand, make
              components reusable by giving components the ability to receive
              data from their parent component in the form of props.{" "}

            UseState returns a pair of (2) values and this pair of values is returned as an array of type containing 2 elements. If we console. If you see its return with log, it will be more convenient to understand.{" "}

              By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do
              something after render. React will remember the function you
              passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later
              after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the
              document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call
              some other imperative API.{" "}

              React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason
              about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible.
              It designs simple views for each state in your application, and
              React will efficiently update and render just the right component
              when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more
              predictable and easier to debug.{" "}
